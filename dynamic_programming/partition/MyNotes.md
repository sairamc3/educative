# Problem
Given an array of Integers, write a function to find out if any two subsets of the given array exist such that the sum of both the subsets is equal. Assume that array will contain only positive numbers.

# My observation

Reading the question does not give complete glimse. 

The solution actually gave the additional characterstics of the problem. 

1. The subsets should be of equal size
2. If the sum of the whole array is array is odd, then we can easily return false.
3. The subset sum should be equal to exactly half of the total sum 

Mutiple approaches have been identified and all of them are present in the corrosponding java class along with comments.
