# Euclidean Algorithm

> Euclidean algorithm is a technique used to compute the greateds common divisor(GCD) of two numbers. i.e., the largest number that divides both the numbers with remainder as zero.

## Principle of Euclidean Algorithm

- Greatest common divisor does not change if the larger value of the two is replaced by difference between both numbers. 
- One can get the result faster if the remainder operator is used instead of simply using the difference

## Problem Statement

Given two numbers `a` and `b`, calculate the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. 

### Sample Input

```java
x=15, y=75
```

### Sample Output

```java
GCD=15
```
