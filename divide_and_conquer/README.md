# Divide and conquer method

It is an algorithmic paradigm in which the problem is repeatedly divided into subproblems, until we reach a point where each problem is **Similar** and **Atomic** i.e., can't be further divided. 

At this point we start solving the atomic problems and combining the solutions together.

This method has 3 steps.

1. Divide
2. Conquer
3. Merge

> Binary Search is a perfect example.
