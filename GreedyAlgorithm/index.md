# Greedy algorithm

Greedy is a algorithm pradigm where the solution is build piece by peice.
The next piece which offers the most obvious and immediete benifit is choosen.
The greedy approach always makes the choice that maximizes the profit and minimises the cost associated with it. 
That means that locally optimized choice is made in the hope that it leads to globally optimal solution.
