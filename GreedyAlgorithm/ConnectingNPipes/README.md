# Connecting 'n' pipes with min cost

## Problem Statement

Given n pipes of different lengths, implment a function that connects these pipes into one pipe.
The cost to connect two pipes is equal to sum of their lengths. 
We need to connect pipes with min cost. 

### Input

The input is an int array where the length is equal to no of pipes available and its indices are specific lengths of pipes.

```java
int[] pipes = {4,2,3,7}; // It means total 4 pipes
                        // having lengths 4,2,3,7 respectively
```

### Output

```java
cost = 30;

```
