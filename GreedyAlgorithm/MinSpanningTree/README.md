## Problem Statement
Implement a function that returns **Mininum Spanning Tree** of a given graph.

### Input
The input is undirected weighted graph

#### Sample Input

| Source | Destination | Weight |
|--------|-------------|--------|
|0|1|10|
|0|2|6|
|0|3|5|
|1|3|15|
|2|3|4|

### Output
The output is min possible spanning tree

#### Sample Output

```
2 -- 3
0 -- 3
0 -- 1
```
